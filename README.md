Polarity refers to the strength of an opinion. It could be positive,negative or neutral. If something has a strong positive feeling or emotion associated with it, such as admiration, trust, love; this will indeed have a certain orientation towards all other aspects of that object’s existence. The same goes for negative polarities. A good example would be the following: ‘I don’t think I’ll buy this item because my previous experience with a similar item wasn’t so good.’ That will have a negative polarity
Subjectivity refers to the degree to which a person is personally involved in an object. What matters the most here are personal connections and individual experiences with that object, which may or may not differ from someone else’s point of view. For example: ‘I’m very happy with my new smartphone because it has the highest performance available on the market.’ Similarly to polarity, strong subjectivity may be negative or positive. The statement here is clearly subjective because the user is actually talking about his experience and how he feels about an object.
